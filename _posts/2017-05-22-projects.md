This past month I graduated from the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering.  
Here are a couple open source projects I managed to sneak in this past semester:

A PyTorch Implementation of a state of the art object detector (Single Shot Multibox Detector):

A convolutional neural net that can classify the genre of a song using only a 3 second clip:

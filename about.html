## About

I am an undergraduate student (senior) at Vanderbilt University finishing up a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Chemistry.  My interests include all fields of machine learning, but I am particularly interested in deep learning and its applications to computer vision, primarily in the medical field.  I would like to eventually pursue a Phd in deep learning and maybe start my own company, but until then I am trying to get involved in all aspects of software engineering and learn as much as possible.

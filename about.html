## About

I am a recent graduate of the Vanderbilt School of Engineering with a major in Computer Science.  My interests include all fields of machine learning, but I am particularly interested in deep learning and its applications to computer vision.  I would like to eventually pursue a Phd in Computer Science with a focus on machine learning and maybe start my own company, but until then I am trying to get involved in all aspects of software engineering and learn as much as possible.
I am an active open source software developer on Github. Here are a couple open source projects I managed to sneak in this past semester:

A PyTorch Implementation of a state of the art object detector (Single Shot Multibox Detector):
https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch

A convolutional neural net that can classify the genre of a song using only a 3 second clip:
https://github.com/amdegroot/deepgenres.torch

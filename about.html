## About

I am a big dreamer with a lot of ideas currently working hard to finish a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Chemistry at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.  My interests include all fields of machine learning, but I am particularly interested in deep learning and its applications to computer vision, primarily in the medical field.  I would like to eventually pursue a Phd in deep learning and maybe start my own company, but until then I am trying to get involved in all aspects of software engineering and learn as much as possible.  I hope that this blog is interesting for some and if anything helps show that learning and understanding the basics of deep learning is actually much simpler than one might think.
